# New-Social-Distancing-Indicator-and-Alarming-System\
This project aims to help monitor and enforce social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. It uses sensors to measure the distance between people and provides feedback when the safety distance is violated.

## Features:
- **Distance Measurement**: Uses ultrasonic sensors to check the distance between individuals.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: RGB LED and buzzer alert when social distancing is violated.
- **PIR Sensor**: Detects human presence to activate the system.
- **LCD Display**: Shows real-time messages on distancing status.

## Components:
- **Arduino Uno**
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**
- **PIR Sensor**
- **RGB LED**
- **Buzzer**
- **LCD Display**

## How It Works:
1. The PIR sensor detects human presence.
2. The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance.
3. If the distance is less than safe limits, the system alerts with a buzzer and red LED.
4. LCD displays messages to guide users.
